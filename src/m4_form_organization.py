# TODO: 1. (5 pts)
#
#   For this _todo_, copy your code from your fillable form from Session 18 and
#   paste it below.
#
#   Now, use the geometry managers we have learned about and reorganize/
#   reformat your fillable form. You must use more than just the pack() method,
#   but you can still use it if it is what you need in a certain spot.
#
#   You may need to add more frames and such to move things around effectively.
#
#   Feel free to be creative on how you want your form to look.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
